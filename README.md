## 📋 Executive Summary  
This project explores **banking sector customer data** to extract actionable insights through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **data visualization**.  
The goal is to help the bank understand its customers better, identify behavioral patterns, and support strategic decisions in **customer retention**, **product marketing**, and **risk management**.  

The repository includes cleaned datasets, Python notebooks, Power BI dashboards, and professional documentation (report + presentation).

## 💡 Business Problem  
Banks face intense competition and pressure to enhance customer experience, minimize churn, and increase profitability.  
This project investigates:
- Which customer segments are most valuable or most at risk?  
- What factors (demographics, tenure, balance, product holding) influence engagement or churn?  
- How can data-driven insights guide marketing and retention strategies?

**Objective:** Transform raw customer data into visual, actionable intelligence to drive informed business decisions.

## ⚙️ Methodology  

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Banking customer datasets containing demographics, balance, product counts, and tenure.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Missing value handling, outlier removal, and formatting inconsistencies fixed using **pandas** and **numpy**.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Statistical summaries, univariate and bivariate exploration.  
   - Visualization using **matplotlib** and **seaborn** (histograms, scatterplots, boxplots, heatmaps).  

4. **Visualization & Dashboarding**  
   - Created an **interactive Power BI dashboard (`Banking Dashboard.pbix`)** to visualize customer segments and KPIs.  

5. **Reporting & Presentation**  
   - Findings summarized in a professional **report (`Banking Report.docx`)** and **slide deck (`Banking.pptx`)**.
